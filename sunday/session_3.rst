Parsing sentences with the OTHER natural language tool: LinkGrammar
===================================================================

**Presenter:** Jeff Elmore

**Track:** IV

**Description:**

    Many of you are probably familiar with NLTK, the wonderful Natural Language Toolkit for Python. You may not be familiar with Linkgrammar, which is a sentence parsing system created at Carnegie Melon university. Linkgrammar is quite robust and works "out of the box" in a way that NLTK does not for sentence parsing.
