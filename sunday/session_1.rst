Sketching a Better Product
==========================

**Presenter:** Idan Gazit

**Track:** I

**Description:**

    If writing is a means for organizing your thoughts, then sketching is a means for organizing your thoughts visually. Just as good writing requires drafts, good design requires sketches: low-investment, low-resolution braindumps. Learn how to use ugly sketching to iterate your way to a better product.

* Sketching is not drawing
* sketching is a tool that serves a purpose
    * to explore visual idea
* drawing is art, it serves itself
* Doesn't matter if you can't draw, sketch
* Sketching is for ideas as drafts are to writing
* sketching is the act of getting out of your head and brin git back through your eyeballs
    * this uses a whole different part of your brain
* sketches should be cheap
    * try stuff, throw bad stuff away
    * try different ideas
* sketches shoudl be fast
    * quick to create
    * low resolution
* sketches should be ugly
    * communicate unfinished nature - make sure to communicate the unfinishedness
    * people might think it's complete if not
* The design funnel
    * sketching user experiences - a book to check out
    * go down the path of ideation to usability
    * sketches -> prototype
    * it's a gradual process
* resolution vs. time
    * spend time after you figure out the good idea
    * don't waste time with polishing bad ideas, sketch them
* what do you need?
    * paper, pen and a wall
    * you need a wall to show off sketches to the rest of the team
* sketching, the 37 signals way
    * two fat markers - black and red

    * it's easy.
    * you need to be able to draw lines
    * you need to be able to draw a box
    * that's all you need, really
    * don't draw text
        * use boxes if it's really big, if smaller use lines
    * greeked text - two lines filled in with squiggles
    * images
        * represent with boxes with an X
    * iconic elements
        * calendars can be grids
* don't worry about it looking bad, just do it
    * and make it quick
    * a great way to think visually
