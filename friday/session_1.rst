Introduction to Metaclasses
===========================

**Presenter:** Luke Sneeringer

**Track:** IV

**Description:**

    Python's metaclasses grant the Python OOP ecosystem all the power of more complex object inheritance systems in other languages, while retaining for most uses the simplicity of the straightforward class structures most developers learn when being introduced to object-oriented programming. This talk is an explanation of metaclasses: first, what they are, and second, how to use them.
