Keynote: Stormy Peters, Mozilla Corporation
===========================================

The Challenge
+++++++++++++

Everybody in this room is defining the future.  Think about how you put the user in control of the web - the average user.

Make a future with cool robots, not a future where companies take you're information without your knowlege.  Keep the web open and accessible.

**Dancing robots!!**

+++++

* How we can create responsible websites
* The Growing Community
* Making tools that are responsible

Growing Community
+++++++++++++++++

* Grow in ways the include the new people and existing.
* 136 sponsors this year, 2004 was a fraction of the sponsors
* Tons of people are here for their first PyCon ever
* Veteran PyCon members should find new attendees and welcome them
* When you meet somebody you have 3 seconds to make an impression
    * First thing they notice is your hair
    * Second is your shoes (she wears toe shoes)
    * Active memebers in the community should encourage people who make the effort to be involved.  Give them a good first impression
* Why people get involved in the community
    * Because they have an itch to scratch
    * But not all of us.
        * People love to learn something new
        * Solving problems
        * To become famous (laughs)
        * They get paid to (typically more diversity is created by this route)
        * Because they believe it should be free and availble to all people
* Everybody stays because of the **Community**
* Community is much more likely to stay involved if you can measure their impact

How can we create responsible websites
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

* Mozilla and Stormy believes in building these tools
* Mozilla is completely open with the web as the platform
* She get's an email from a person from Mongolia
    * He's excited because he's a teacher and in Mongolia you can't checkout books from the library, but his students can get these books on their phone because of html books from Mozilla.
    * Kids in Mongolia have cell phones, but not very many books
* By keeping the web open and software free we can change the world. 
* People make huge sacrifices to make this open web
* The challenge is to keep pushing, keep going.  Still more to be done.
* Free != Open
* How can we make websites and services to offer people freedoom

Making Tools
++++++++++++ 

* You have to give users tools along the way so that they don't feel disempowered when they can't to their data
* We need fewer 'it doesn't work'
* The do not track movement
    * BrowserId
    * Logging into websites with profiles
    * Give people ways to delete and remove those profiles
    * It's hard to delete your online identity
* We need to rethink the way we build websites
* How these interact with our online identity
    * Our different devices
* Keep the user in control and responsble
* Education is important, but it needs to be more than this
    * Let user know what they are actually doing on the web, what data they are putting out there

Closing
+++++++

* Grow the community responsibly 
* Create tools the give users control
* Make nice friendly robots

**How do we make sure the future is a place where the users have control**
