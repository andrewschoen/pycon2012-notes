Extracting musical information from sound
=========================================

**Presenter:** Adrian Holovaty

**Track:** III

**Description:**

    Music Information Retrieval technology has gotten good enough that you extract musical metadata from your sound files with some degree of accuracy. Find out how to use Python (along with third-party APIs) to determine everything from the key/tempo of a song to the pitch/timbre of individual notes. Then we'll do some amusing analysis of popular tunes.
