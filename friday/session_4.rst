Code Generation in Python: Dismantling Jinja
============================================

**Presenter:** Armin Ronacher

**Track:** III

**Description:**

    For many DSLs such as templating languages it's important to use code generation to achieve acceptable performance in Python. The current version of Jinja went through many different iterations to end up where it is currently. This talk walks through the design of Jinja2's compiler infrastructure and why it works the way it works and how one can use newer Python features for better results.
