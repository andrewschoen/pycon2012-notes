Keynote: Paul Graham, YCombinator
=================================

This is way bigger than the last PyCon we talked at.  It was 2002.  Just a small fraction of the attendance today.

What is silicon valley like?

* The center of silicon valley moves around.
* Where is the greatest collection of people who want to make stuff happen

**We are in the center of silicon valley right now, right here**

A list of 7 Giant startup ideas (be a billionaire!!)

* The biggest startup ideas are frightening
* The threaten your identity
* Start the next google
* The right ideas are just on the right side of impossible
* Microsoft really lost their way when they got into the search business
    * The did this because they were afraid of Google
* Google may have peaked, but doesn't mean there is a room for a new search engine
* Paul is nostalgic to the old google.
* Now results are like scientology results. What's true is true for you (big laughs)

Find the tiny thing that turns into the giant idea.  Find the dinosaur egg.

Replace Google
++++++++++++++

* make a search engine that all the hackers use
* Maybe only 10,000 users but you'd be in a powerful position
* Make the search engine you want

Replace Email
+++++++++++++

* Email is a to-do list not communication
* But it's a shitty to-do list
* Tweaking the inbox is not enough
* Make a to-do list protocal
* Gives more power to the receipent
* People send emails to themselves is proof of this (I do this all the time)
* Entreanched protocols are almost impossible to replace
* But it's time
* Powerful people are in pain because of email
    * This means you can make money on this idea!!
    * You have a dinosaur chicken!
    * Build it and make it fast
* He could justify spending tons of money on this

Replace Universities
++++++++++++++++++++

* Is reluctant to suggest this.
* The last couple decades universities have went down a bad path
* They are like expensive country clubs
* Might get replaced by a whole bunch of little things
    * Many will not look like universities at all
* Change the way people learn
* Universities are kinda like a credential at this point
    * So maybe crenditals have to be done outside of this

Kill Hollywood
++++++++++++++

**Huge Applause**

* Slow to embrace the internet
* Can now call the winner for delievry mechanism for entertainment
    * It is the Internet
* Hates TVs
* Some of the attention people spend watching TV can be stole by other things
* Still a residual demand for people who want to watch a story unfold
* How do we deliver drama via the Internet
    * Must be on a larger scale than YouTube
* Two ways delivery and payment can play out

A new Apple
+++++++++++

* Was talking to somebody who knew Apple well.  Asks the question, "Post Steve Jobs can Apple still innovate"  Answer: No
* Who is going to make the next iPad
    * Maybe none of the existing players
* Only want to get a product visionary as CEO is for that person to start the company.  (And that person doesn't get fired)
* The next Apple is a start up
* Who's going to make the future
* There is a vacuum.  Ready for a new company to lead the way.
    * People are used to following

Bring back the old Moore's Law
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

* Hardware was solving softwares problems
* Not anymore
* Would be great if a start up could give back something of the old Moore's Law
* Make many CPU's look and act like one super fast one
* Programmers like convience
* In world of web services we don't see processors anymore
* Instead of the compiler, build stuff out of smaller components. (hadoop, map / reduce)
* Create a market place for optimization
    * Write bots to do the optimization

Ongoing Diagnosis
+++++++++++++++++

* Imagine the ways we will seem backwards to people in the future
* Ridiculous we have to wait for symptoms to know we have problems
    * Example: heart problems
    * Have to wait until your arteries are 90% blocked to know there is a problem
* Surely, in the future this will happen.  People will know how blocked their arteries are like their weight
* Next example, Cancer
* Traditionally you feel symptoms, go to the Dr.  Need to start looking for problems pro-actively. 
* If people are scanned all the time - there will be less freak-out moments
* Going against thousand of years of medical history

Conclusion
+++++++++++

* If you want to take on a problem, don't make a frontal attack.  
* Don't say you're replacing email, say you're building to-do list software
* Start with small things, make them bigger
* Start small for your own sake, not for other people
* Bigger your ambitions the longer they take to realize
    * The more you have to look into the future, the more you'll be wrong
* Columbus "There is something in the West"
* Blurry view of the future is the best

Questions
+++++++++

* The idea of what is property?  What is convient to be called property.  Land didn't used to be, but it is now.
* Now files move around like smells.  Doesn't make sense to charge people for copies anymore.
* Question about Replacing universities.  Other value to them than learning.
    * Would it be bad if people don't physically meet?  Things have to happen in person.
    * Things can be made that involve people meeting in person.
* Get a degree from people, not institutions
* Maybe universities used to be like this
