Designing Embedded Systems with Linux and Python
================================================

**Presenter:** Mark Kohler

**Track:** I 

**Description:**

    The continual decrease in the cost of computer hardware is allowing more embedded systems to be built with Linux and Python, instead of the traditional approach of a real-time operating system and C. This talk reviews the differences between those approaches and describes problems, solutions, and tools that can be used when building embedded systems with Python.
