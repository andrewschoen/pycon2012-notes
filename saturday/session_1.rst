Why PyPy by example
===================

**Presenters:** Maciej Fijalkowski , Alex Gaynor , Armin Rigo

**Track:** II

**Description:**

    One of the goals of PyPy is to make existing Python code faster, however an even broader goal was to make it possible to write things in Python that previous would needed to be written in C or other low-level language. This talk will show examples of this, and describe how they represent the tremendous progress PyPy has made, and what it means for people looking to use PyPy.
