Django Form Processing Deep Dive
================================

**Presenter:** Nathan Yergler

**Track:** V

**Description:**

    Django Form processing often takes a back seat to flashier, more visible parts of the framework. But Django forms, fully leveraged, can help developers be more productive and write more cohesive code. This talk will dive deep into the stock Django forms package, as well as discuss a strategy for abstracting validation for forms, and the use of unit and integration tests with forms.
