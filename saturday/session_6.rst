Using fabric to standardize the development process
===================================================

**Presenter:** Ricardo Kirkner

**Track:** IV

**Description:**

    By ensuring consistency and repeatability in setting up the development environments of a team of developers, errors can be avoided (by automating repetitive tasks). It also helps by lowering the entry barrier for new developers, and letting existing developers focus on development tasks without having to worry about infrastructure or process issues.
