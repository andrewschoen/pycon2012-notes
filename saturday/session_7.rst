Building a Robot that Can Play Angry Birds on a Smartphone, (or Robots are the Future of Testing)
=================================================================================================

**Presenter:** Jason Huggins

**Track:** V

**Description:** 

    Can your robot play Angry Birds? On an iPhone? Mine can. I call it "BitbeamBot". It started as an art project, but it has a much more serious practical application: mobile web testing. To trust that your mobile app truly works, you need an end-to-end test on the actual device. BitbeamBot is an Arduino-powered open-source hardware CNC robot that can test any application on any mobile device.

**Gave a demo of the robot playing angry birds (big apploause)**

The name of the project is bitbeam (bitbeam.org)

The original idea was to build a robot fish, after the robot dog from sony in 1998

* fish swim in a sine wave
* while researching sine waves he became fascinated with 3d simulations
* liked the motorized pin art and had the idea of building 3d simulations using them
    * to buy the parts was very expensive, so he designed his own linear actuator
    * realized the linear actuator could be used for clicking buttons / testing
* currently works at Selenium and is hoping to make bitbeambot selenium powered

**Why?**

* selenium is a software-based robot
* it's mission is to mimic and automate user actions
* for mobile you this means you have to integrate with the device
* this is an experiment to take Selenium out of the screen and into the real world
* using opencv is find the 'bird' in angry birds
    * eventually wants to use this to have the bitbeambot be more robust in playing the game and in future uses
* shows an example of the bot playing tic-tac-toe

This talk was full of demos, check out the video when it's posted.
